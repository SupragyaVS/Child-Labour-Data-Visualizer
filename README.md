# Child Labor Data Visualizer
Database Management System Project on Global Child Labour using SQL and Tableau

This GitHub repository presents an in-depth analysis of global child labor statistics using SQL queries and further visualized using Tableau. The project aims to provide insights into the prevalence and trends of child labor worldwide, offering a comprehensive view of the data through statistical analysis and data visualization.

The core of this project lies in the SQL queries used to extract, manipulate, and analyze the dataset. The SQL queries cover a wide range of analytical tasks, including:

1. Aggregating child labor statistics by region and country.  
2. Calculating the percentage of child laborers in different age groups.   
3. Identifying trends and changes in child labor prevalence over time.   
4. Analyzing gender-specific patterns in child labor.  
And more.

These SQL queries are structured to provide detailed insights into the dataset, uncovering meaningful patterns and trends.

Contributions to this project are welcome.
